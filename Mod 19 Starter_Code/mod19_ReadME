## Credits
This project was created by me primarily referencing the material covered in class. As per usual, I did a fair bit of googling and  came up short almost everywhere. I checked out the documentation recommended at https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Building_Composite_Objects.html & several other places on the official holoviews site.
